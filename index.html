                  Project Creek Watch, started in the Fall of 1994, is a long term scientific
                  study of the Arroyo Del Valle &quot;Creek&quot; located in
                  the city of <a href="http://www.ci.pleasanton.ca.us/">Pleasanton</a>,
                  California. This project is sponsored &amp; coordinated by
                  the <a href="http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/amador/faculty/science/default.html">Amador
                  Valley High School Science Department</a> which is part of
                  the <a href="http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/">Pleasanton Unified
                  School District</a>. It was awarded the prestigious California
                  Golden Bell Award for excellence in education in 1999. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
                goal of the project is to provide field experience opportunities
                for Amador science students while at the same time support efforts
                in transforming the &quot;creek&quot; channel into an environment
                that is respected, enjoyed, and maintained by the Pleasanton
                Community. It is critical that we understand that how we treat
                this watershed effects what is downstream from it and ultimately
                the marine environment. The web site
                will hopefully act as inspiration to other organizations to initiate
                similar habitat reclamation projects and promote a heightened
                level of concern about the &quot;Land Sea&quot; connection. We
                all need to work together to reclaim all that has been overlooked
                or forgotten and stop the flow of toxics into our oceans. We
                must recognize that habitat protection and stable biologically
                diverse ecosystems must be a priority. Our children and children's
                children are depending on it.</font></p>

                the creek site requires a short walk from my classroom. We typically
                will get there and back in a single class period. While at the
                study site, Amador students assess water quality by collecting
                chemical measurements, capturing indicator species, and making
                qualitative observations regarding the abundance and distribution
                of flora and fauna. Grant money provided by the Amador <a href="http://www.amadorvalleyptsa.org/">Parent
                Teacher Student Association</a>, <a href="http://www.ppie.org/">Pleasanton
                Partners In Education</a> and the <a href="http://www.tvcfoundation.org/">Tri
                Valley Community Fund</a> have enabled us to purchase the necessary
                tools to collect, store, and display what we have found. Significant
                changes have been observed over the years and fortunately
                most have been positive. Recently the city has followed our lead
                and began introducing native plant species accompanied by wire
                to protect the plants from deer and irrigation to sustain the
                young plants during the summer. We envision that one day the
                Arroyo Del Valle &quot;creek&quot; will be a place where members
                of the Pleasanton community will enjoy bringing their children
                to observe and appreciate an abundance of wildlife. </font></p>
