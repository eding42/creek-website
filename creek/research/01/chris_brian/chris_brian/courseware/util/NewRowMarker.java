First problem report from CourseWare use in a course. * @author Ginger Booth * @version 0.3, 99/02/01 * * A NewRowMarker is added to the components() Vector of "components for one * line of popup to set this parameter." This allows one Vector of "components", * but with markers showing the need for a newline. The "new row" generally * needs to be indented, since there can be a bunch of "one line" parameters on * a single menu. Since TableLayout takes care of sizing up fields to line up * vertically, the only indentation measure needed is columns in. Like, 0 means * flush left, 1 means start in 2nd column on popup.... */package courseware.util;public class NewRowMarker {  public int startColumn = 0;  public NewRowMarker(int startInColumn) {    startColumn = startInColumn;  }  public NewRowMarker() {    startColumn = 0;  }}
