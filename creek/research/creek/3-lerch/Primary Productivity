In other words, Primary Productivity is how fast an organism can turn light into energy.  Some ways you can find the rate of Primary Productivity by observing plants and discovering their weight per area.  Or you can find the photosynthesis rate by testing the dissolved oxegyn. <P><P>QUESTION- Is our creek producers making enough food to keep our creek healthy?<P><P>HYPOTHESIS- We believe that if the levels of dissolved oxegyn vary greatly from our constant, then our creek is healthy.<P><P>EXPERIMENT- <BR>     <BR>          1. Take two glass bottles of the same size and wrap one completely in aluminum foil (this  			            		   <BR>               will be your constant)<P>										2. Fill the bottles with the same amount of water from the creek making sure that no air  <BR>															gets inside.<P>										3. Place the bottles inside the creek for any amount of time you wish.<P>										4. Remove from creek and test the dissolved oxygen level.  Compare.<P><P>OBSERVATION-<P>          We discovered that the levels of dissolved oxygen  were not much different showing that our creek isn't as healthy as we thought it was.   Here is a table of data we collected.<P><P><table border=4><tr><td>SITE</TD><TD>TIME/DATE</TD><TD>D.O. LEVEL-ALUMINUM</TD><TD>D.O.

We came to this conclusion because the levels of dissolved oxygen do not vary.<P>											We believe that the creek is healthy because it does have life.  Why is our creek unhealthy?  Maybe  if we solved the problem causeing the unhealthiness, our creek would gave more plant and animal life.  The next step to having a gealthy creek is to find out what is causeing the problems
